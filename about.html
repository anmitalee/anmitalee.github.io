            <p>Hello, my name is Tam. I'm currently a retail pharmacist for Safeway. Technology has made my work much easier. For example, instead of spending time decipher doctors’ handwriting, electronic prescribing takes all the guess work out and most of the information are transmitted directly from the doctor office into the pharmacy system, eliminating chances for human errors. Therefore, with the support from my husband, who is also a software developer, I started my journey to explore the world of technology. My first step was the MIT Professional Certificate in Coding Course. In the first section of the course, I’ve learned JavaScript, CSS and HTML which enable me to work on some fun projects such as re-creating a simple version of the Pacman game, a pair of eyes that move along with the user’s mouse movement or tracking bus stops along a specific route. The more I learn, the more passionate I want to explore what technology can do for humankind. I’m looking forward to continuing my journey with the upcoming sections on Front-End and Back-End development.</p>
